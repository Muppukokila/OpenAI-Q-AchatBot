ðŸš€ Built My First AI Chatbot with OpenAI & Streamlit! ðŸ¤–

Excited to share that I have successfully built and deployed an AI-powered Q&A chatbot using OpenAI, LangChain, and Streamlit! ðŸŽ‰

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
âœ… Uses OpenAI's GPT models for intelligent responses
âœ… Built with LangChain for enhanced prompt management
âœ… Simple & interactive Streamlit UI
âœ… Adjustable settings for temperature & max tokens
âœ… Secure API key handling with .env

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
ðŸ”¹ Python | Streamlit | OpenAI API | LangChain | dotenv

ðŸ“Œ Test Question:
ðŸ’¬ "What is GenAI"
ðŸ¤– "GenAI" typically stands for "Generative AI," which refers to a subset of artificial intelligence techniques used to generate content. This content can include text, images, music, and other forms of media. Generative AI models are trained on large datasets and can produce new examples that mimic the characteristics of the training data.
One of the most well-known examples of generative AI is the language model GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which can generate human-like text based on input prompts. Other applications include generating realistic images with models like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion, creating music, and even designing objects.
Generative AI holds promise for many applications, such as content creation, design, entertainment, and more, but also raises ethical considerations." (Boom! It works! ðŸš€)

Next Steps? Looking to add memory and user authentication! ðŸ”¥
